            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p>
              I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs
              after deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no
              catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business
              was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and
              all the customers were guests in my home.
            </p>

            <p>
              After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not
              yet learnt the art of the business but have mastered the art of
              being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food
              I serve to my family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site
              and served immediately to our guests.
            </p>
